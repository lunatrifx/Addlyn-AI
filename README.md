# Addlyn-AI


Addlyn is the second iteration of a Twitter bot I made on 01/20/22. Nothing special about it, other than this time it runs off of 4 different OpenAI prompts integrated into the code. Further updates currently being worked on include moving to analyze data by web scraping and producing statistics in addition to production of normal comments using OpenAI's API.


Addlyn took 12 hours to code in total. I did make the 3D rendition of her from Blender and I would say that added another 27 hours since I had to resculpt, rerig then compose and also rig the custom clothing of Addlyn. In total, 39 hours in total was dedicated in bringing Addlyn back to Twitter.


The one thing I highly suggest to those who want to follow along with this project is to pay attention to where everything is going on your computer and what your workflow on Xcode for Python is. People who are more experienced with Twitter API should get this done in about 4-6 hours.

## Currently supported platforms 

Addlyn can be run on the following platforms with more to come: 
  - Google Colab w/ Cloud Scheduler or local IDE (for code)
  - Apple M1+ (8.0 GB+) / Windows Equivalent (for rendering and live capture)
