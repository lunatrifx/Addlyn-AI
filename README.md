# Addlyn-AI


Addlyn is the second iteration of a data science project I first made on June 22, 2019. Nothing special about it, other than this time it runs off of 4 different OpenAI prompts integrated into the code.


Addlyn took 12 hours to code in total. I did make the 3D rendition of her on Blender and I would say that added another 27 hours since I had to resculpt, rerig then compose and also rig the custom clothing. In total, 39 hours in total was dedicated in bringing my project back to Twitter and now my own website hosted on Github Pages.


The one thing I highly suggest to those who want to follow along with this project is to pay attention to where everything is going on your computer and what your workflow for your IDE is (p.s. DON'T USE Xcode FOR PYTHON!! It is a total pain to work with, but hey CoreML is pretty good.)

## Currently supported platforms 

Addlyn is recommended to be run on the following platforms with more to come: 

TBA; currently working a complete overhaul. If anything to state at the moment, a computer that is CUDA equipped with 15GB VRAM - in addition to minimum 8GB RAM for general system requirements. Use Tensorflow for CPU if you don't have the latter - it should work fine.

# Version History 

I'm just putting this here to clear up the Twitter bio and ultimately if you're curious about Addlyn-AI.

Version 1.0.0 (2019-2021): Known as Jxea, this iteration dealt with open voice capture which was inspired by a project I did in my 3rd year high school PLTW electronics class. Like versions after it, there was a server (here, in the form of an Arduino) that served as the place of voice capture and posting to Twitter. 

Version 2.0.0 (2022-2023): This iteration moved away from open voice capture and into the first integration of an API. Using OpenAI's ChatGPT API, I created a source of 4 prompts it can draw from: some prompts included making 'news', quotes with who said it from what show, and getting sports data. Like how OpenAI explicitly stated that its cutoff was 2021 and can hallucinate information, Addlyn incorrectly pinned quotes or made up quotes to a series. The jokes generated were a hit or miss as well. This bot also was able to utilize Apple Shortcuts as its final ability; I wrote a script which was able to take what ever I was listening to and post it on to Twitter. 

Version 3.0.0 (2024-): I am planning a complete overhaul since I learned a whole lot since I stopped working on this project and also since I lost the Twitter profile earlier last year. I am also planning on moving away from using Twitter as the hosting website, which greatly improves what this model is capable of.
