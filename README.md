# Addlyn-AI


Addlyn is the second iteration of a Twitter bot I made on 01/20/22. Nothing special about it, other than this time it runs off of 4 different OpenAI prompts integrated into the code. I plan to make minor adjustments to Addlyn as I go along, such as making it run automatically at a set time or times in the day without opening my Xcode repository. 


Addlyn took 12 hours to make in terms of the coding in total. I did make the 3D rendition of her from Blender and I would say that added another 27 hours since I had to resculpt, rerig then compose and also rig the custom clothing of Addlyn. If my math is correct that should be 39 hours in total I dedicated to bring Addlyn back to Twitter.


The one thing I highly suggest to those who want to follow along with this project is to pay attention to where everything is going on your computer and what your workflow on Xcode for Python is. People who are more experienced with Twitter API should get this done in about 4-6 hours.
