# Addlyn-AI


Addlyn is the second iteration of a Twitter bot I made on 01/20/22. Nothing special about it, other than this time it runs off of 4 different OpenAI prompts integrated into the code. I plan to make minor adjustments to Addlyn as I go along, such as making it run automatically at a set time or times in the day without opening my Xcode repository. 


Addlyn took 12 hours to make in total.
